# Advanced Instructions & Cautions for Desk Comparator

## 🎯 Purpose & Core Functionality

This tool compares two Excel inventory/desk reports and identifies serial number mismatches per desk. It's designed for MNTR (monitor) tracking across desk locations.

**📌 Production Version**: This is a production-ready release with all debug logging removed. The tool runs cleanly without creating log files.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CAUTIONS & WATCHOUTS

### 🔴 **FILE HANDLING CAUTIONS**

#### **1. Excel Files MUST Be Closed**
- **❌ ERROR**: "Permission denied" or file locked errors
- **✓ FIX**: Close ALL instances of the input files in Excel before running
- **WHY**: Windows locks files opened in Excel, preventing read access
- **TIP**: Check Task Manager if error persists - Excel may be running in background

#### **2. Output File Location**
- **❌ DANGER**: If previous output file is open in Excel, save will fail
- **✓ SOLUTION**: Close all Excel files in output folder before running
- **NOTE**: Tool automatically timestamps output files (`desk_mismatches_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`)

#### **3. Large File Performance**
- **⚠️ WARNING**: Files with >10,000 rows may take 30+ seconds
- **⚠️ MEMORY**: Files with >50,000 rows may consume 1GB+ RAM
- **TIP**: Monitor progress bar - if stuck >2 minutes at same %, restart tool
- **OPTIMIZATION**: Tool only reads columns needed (Desk_ID, Type, S.N*, skan*)

#### **4. File Format Requirements**
- **✓ SUPPORTED**: `.xlsx`, `.xls` (Excel 2003+)
- **❌ NOT SUPPORTED**: `.csv`, `.txt`, `.xlsm` macros, password-protected files
- **REQUIRED STRUCTURE**:
  - Must have column headers in first row
  - Serial columns MUST start with `S.N` (e.g., `S.N1`, `S.N2`, `S.N3`)
  - Type column should contain `MNTR` for monitor records

---

### 🟡 **DATA STRUCTURE WATCHOUTS**

#### **1. Desk_ID Normalization Behavior**
**AUTOMATIC TRANSFORMATIONS:**
```
Input          → Output     (Reason)
-----------------------------------------
"R123"         → "R1230"    (3-digit number gets 0 appended)
"R-123"        → "R1230"    (punctuation removed + 0 appended)
"room 456"     → "Room4560" (spaces removed, capitalized, 0 added)
"r.1.2.3"      → "R1230"    (dots removed, normalized)
""             → "Blanks"   (empty becomes "Blanks")
"  "           → "Blanks"   (whitespace becomes "Blanks")
```

**⚠️ CAUTION**: This normalization is IRREVERSIBLE in output
- **IMPACT**: "R123" and "R1230" in source files will be treated as SAME desk
- **WHY**: Ensures consistency across different data entry formats
- **WATCHOUT**: If you have BOTH "R123" and "R1230" as separate desks, they'll merge!

#### **2. Serial Number Normalization**
**AUTOMATIC TRANSFORMATIONS:**
```
Input              → Output        (Action)
-------------------------------------------------
"ABC-123-XYZ"      → "ABC123XYZ"  (hyphens removed)
"abc 123 xyz"      → "ABC123XYZ"  (spaces removed, uppercased)
"  V12345  "       → "V12345"     (trimmed, uppercased)
"0V12345"          → [see below]  (special skan logic)
```

**🔴 SPECIAL CASE - Serials Starting with "0":**
If serial starts with "0" AND `skan` or `skan2` columns exist:
1. Looks for 'V' in skan → uses substring from 'V' onward
2. Else looks for digits starting with '6' → prepends 'V'
3. Otherwise keeps original value

**Example:**
```
Serial: "012345"  +  skan: "ABC6789012"  →  Serial becomes: "V6789012"
Serial: "012345"  +  skan: "V012345"     →  Serial becomes: "V012345"
Serial: "012345"  +  skan: ""            →  Serial stays: "012345"
```

#### **3. Blank Desk Assignment Logic**
**CRITICAL BEHAVIOR:**

When a serial has blank/missing Desk_ID:
1. **First**: Try to infer from the OTHER file (if serial maps to single desk)
2. **Second**: Try to infer Room from ALL observed mappings (if all same room)
3. **Last Resort**: Assign to "Unassigned" category

**⚠️ WATCHOUT Examples:**
```
File 1: Serial ABC123 → Desk "R101"
File 2: Serial ABC123 → Desk "" (blank)
RESULT: Both assigned to R101 in output ✓

File 1: Serial XYZ999 → Desks "R101", "R102" (appears twice)
File 2: Serial XYZ999 → Desk "" (blank)
RESULT: Assigned to "Unassigned" (ambiguous mapping) ⚠️

File 1: Serial DEF456 → Desks "R101", "R201"
File 2: Serial DEF456 → Desk "" (blank)
RESULT: If R101 and R201 are different rooms → "Unassigned"
        If both in same room (e.g., both "R") → Assigned to "R" room
```

#### **4. Type Column Filtering**
- **IF** `Type` column exists → **ONLY** `MNTR` rows processed
- **IF** `Type` column missing → **ALL** rows processed
- **⚠️ WATCHOUT**: Typos like "MNTR ", "mntr", "MONITOR" will be EXCLUDED
- **TIP**: Ensure Type column has exact value "MNTR" (case-sensitive)

---

### 🟢 **COLUMN NAMING CONVENTIONS**

#### **Required/Recognized Column Names:**

| Column Pattern | Purpose | Case Sensitive? | Examples |
|----------------|---------|-----------------|----------|
| `S.N*` | Serial numbers | **YES** - must start with "S.N" | `S.N1`, `S.N2`, `S.N3` ✓<br>`Serial1`, `SN1` ❌ |
| `Desk_ID` | Desk identifier | **NO** | `Desk_ID`, `desk_id`, `DESK_ID` ✓ |
| `Type` | Record type filter | **NO** | `Type`, `type`, `TYPE` ✓ |
| `skan`, `skan2` | Serial derivation | **NO** | Used for serials starting with "0" |
| `Place`, `Room` | Backup desk ID | **NO** | Used when Desk_ID is blank |

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Serial columns MUST start with exact string `S.N` (capital S, period, capital N)

**Examples:**
```
✓ VALID:    S.N1, S.N2, S.N3, S.N_Monitor, S.N-Primary
❌ INVALID: SN1, S.N, Serial1, S_N1, S N1
```

---

### 🔧 **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION TIPS**

#### **1. File Size Optimization**
```
BEFORE running, consider:
- Remove unnecessary columns (keep only: Desk_ID, Type, S.N*, skan*)
- Filter to MNTR type BEFORE exporting to Excel
- Remove completely empty rows
```

#### **2. Memory Management**
**Tool automatically:**
- Reads only necessary columns
- Filters MNTR rows immediately after reading
- Processes data in batches (50 desks per batch)
- Frees memory progressively throughout execution

**If you experience slowdowns:**
- Close other applications
- Restart the tool if stuck >2 minutes
- Consider splitting very large files (>50K rows) into multiple runs

#### **3. Progress Bar Interpretation**
```
0-10%    : File validation and reading
10-25%   : Filtering and normalization
25-40%   : Serial column identification
40-70%   : Building desk/serial mappings
70-85%   : Computing mismatches
85-95%   : Aggregating results
95-100%  : Saving Excel output
```

**⚠️ Known Slow Points:**
- **Around 26-30%**: Desk ID normalization (large files may pause here)
- **Around 75-85%**: Batch processing of desk comparisons
- **Around 95%**: Excel formatting and saving

### 📊 **OUTPUT FILE STRUCTURE**

#### **Column Definitions:**
| Column | Content | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `Room` | Room identifier extracted from Desk_ID | "R" from "R1230" |
| `Desk_Number` | Desk number extracted from Desk_ID | "1230" from "R1230" |
| `Only_in_File1` | Serials present ONLY in first file | "ABC123, DEF456" |
| `Only_in_File2` | Serials present ONLY in second file | "XYZ999, GHI789" |

#### **🔍 How to Read the Output:**

The output shows **ONLY MISMATCHES** - serials that differ between the two files. Matching serials are automatically excluded.

**Example Output:**

| Room | Desk_Number | Only_in_File1 | Only_in_File2 |
|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| R | 1230 | V123456 | |
| R | 1450 | | V789012, V654321 |
| T | 890 | V111222 | V333444 |

**How to interpret each row:**

1. **Room + Desk_Number**: Identifies which desk has mismatches

2. **Only_in_File1**: Serial numbers found in File 1 but **MISSING** from File 2
   - ✓ These devices are registered in File 1
   - ✗ These devices are NOT found in File 2
   - **Action needed**: Add these serials to File 2 OR remove from File 1

3. **Only_in_File2**: Serial numbers found in File 2 but **MISSING** from File 1
   - ✓ These devices are registered in File 2
   - ✗ These devices are NOT found in File 1
   - **Action needed**: Add these serials to File 1 OR remove from File 2

4. **Both columns populated**: The desk has completely different serials in each file
   - Example: Row 3 above shows desk T890 has V111222 in File 1 but V333444 in File 2
   - **Action needed**: Investigate which is correct

5. **Multiple serials**: When a desk has multiple mismatched serials, they appear comma-separated
   - Example: `V789012, V654321` means TWO serials are missing

**Real-World Scenarios:**

```
Scenario 1: Serial Added to File 2
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ File 1: Desk R1230 has V123456                 │
│ File 2: Desk R1230 has V123456, V789012        │
│ Output: R | 1230 | | V789012                   │
│ Meaning: V789012 is new in File 2              │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Scenario 2: Serial Removed from File 2
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ File 1: Desk R1230 has V123456, V789012        │
│ File 2: Desk R1230 has V123456                 │
│ Output: R | 1230 | V789012 |                   │
│ Meaning: V789012 was removed from File 2       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Scenario 3: Complete Mismatch
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ File 1: Desk R1230 has V111111                 │
│ File 2: Desk R1230 has V222222                 │
│ Output: R | 1230 | V111111 | V222222           │
│ Meaning: Different serials - investigate!      │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Scenario 4: Perfect Match (NOT in output)
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ File 1: Desk R1230 has V123456, V789012        │
│ File 2: Desk R1230 has V123456, V789012        │
│ Output: [NO ROW FOR R1230]                     │
│ Meaning: Serials match - nothing to report ✓   │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:**
- **If a desk is NOT in the output**, it means ALL serials match between files ✓
- **Empty output file** = All serials match perfectly across both files ✓
- The tool handles different file structures automatically:
  - **File 1**: Multiple serial columns per desk (S.N1, S.N2, etc.)
  - **File 2**: One serial per row
  - Both are normalized before comparison!

#### **Special Output Rows:**
- **"Blanks"**: Serials where Desk_ID was empty/blank in BOTH files
- **"Unassigned"**: Serials where desk couldn't be inferred (ambiguous)
- **"Dom"**: Highlighted in YELLOW and moved to END of output

#### **Output Formatting:**
- Headers: **Bold** and **centered**
- All cells: **Centered** with **text wrapping** enabled
- Column widths: **Auto-adjusted** to content
- Dom rows: **Yellow background**

### 🐛 **TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES**

#### **Issue 1: "No serial columns found!"**
**Cause**: Serial columns don't start with `S.N`
**Solution**: 
```
1. Open your Excel file
2. Check column headers
3. Rename columns to: S.N1, S.N2, S.N3, etc.
4. Save and re-run
```

#### **Issue 2: Tool hangs at 26%**
**Possible Causes**:
- Very large file (>50K rows)
- Corrupted Excel file
- Out of memory

**Solutions**:
```
1. Wait 2-3 minutes (large files take time)
2. Close other applications to free memory
3. Restart the tool
4. Try with smaller subset of data
```

#### **Issue 3: Output file has unexpected "Blanks" or "Unassigned"**
**Causes**:
- Source data has empty Desk_ID values
- Serial appears in multiple desks (ambiguous)
- Desk_ID format inconsistencies

**Investigation Steps**:
```
1. Review the output file carefully
2. Search for the serial number in both source files
3. Check source files for that serial's desk assignments
4. Ensure Desk_ID consistency (R123 vs R1230 vs R-123)
```

#### **Issue 4: "Permission denied" on save**
**Cause**: Previous output file is open in Excel
**Solution**:
```
1. Close ALL Excel windows
2. Check Task Manager → End "Microsoft Excel" if running
3. Re-run comparison
```

#### **Issue 5: Results don't match expectations**
**Common Reasons**:
1. **Normalization**: "R123" becomes "R1230" automatically
2. **Type Filtering**: Only MNTR rows processed if Type column exists
3. **Case Sensitivity**: Serial "abc123" matches "ABC123"
4. **Whitespace**: "ABC123 " matches "ABC123"

**Debug Steps**:
```
1. Verify source data in Excel (look for hidden spaces, formatting)
2. Test with smaller subset to isolate issue
3. Check for Type column typos or inconsistent values
```

### 💡 **BEST PRACTICES**

#### **1. Data Preparation**
```
✓ DO:
- Standardize Desk_ID format before comparison
- Use consistent Type values ("MNTR" only)
- Keep serial columns named S.N1, S.N2, etc.
- Remove extra whitespace from data

❌ DON'T:
- Mix formats (R123 and R1230 as different desks)
- Use merged cells in header row
- Have multiple rows of headers
- Include formulas in serial columns
```

### 🔬 **ADVANCED CONFIGURATION**

#### **Modifying Normalization Rules** (requires code editing)

**To change 3-digit zero-padding behavior:**
```python
# Line 85 in normalize_desk_series()
mask = s.str.match(r'^[A-Za-z]*\d{3}$')  # Change \d{3} to \d{4} for 4-digit

# Or disable zero-padding entirely:
# Comment out lines 88-91
```

**To change serial derivation rules:**
```python
# Lines 132-147 in _derive_serial_from_skan()
# Modify regex patterns for different skan formats
```

**⚠️ CAUTION**: Code changes require Python knowledge and testing!

### 📚 **APPENDIX: Understanding the Algorithm**

#### **Processing Pipeline:**
```
1. VALIDATE
   ├─ Check files exist and are readable
   ├─ Test output folder is writable
   └─ Read column headers

2. LOAD & FILTER
   ├─ Read only necessary columns (Desk_ID, Type, S.N*, skan*)
   ├─ Filter to Type=='MNTR' (if Type column exists)
   └─ Handle empty dataframes

3. NORMALIZE
   ├─ Fix blank Desk_IDs using Place/Room columns
   ├─ Normalize Desk_IDs (remove punctuation, capitalize, pad numbers)
   ├─ Apply skan-based serial derivation (for serials starting with 0)
   └─ Normalize serials (remove punctuation, uppercase)

4. RESHAPE
   ├─ Melt serial columns into long format
   ├─ Split Desk_ID into Room + Desk_Number
   └─ Drop NA serials

5. BUILD MAPPINGS
   ├─ Create Serial → Desk dictionaries (both files)
   ├─ Create Desk → Serial set dictionaries (both files)
   └─ Identify ambiguous mappings (one serial, multiple desks)

6. COMPARE
   ├─ For each desk: compute set difference of serials
   ├─ Identify serials in File1 only
   ├─ Identify serials in File2 only
   └─ Process in batches for memory efficiency

7. INFER MISSING
   ├─ For blank Desk_IDs: try to infer from other file
   ├─ If ambiguous: try to infer Room from all mappings
   └─ Last resort: assign to "Unassigned"

8. AGGREGATE
   ├─ Group by (Room, Desk_Number)
   ├─ Join multiple serials with ", "
   └─ Remove duplicates

9. FORMAT & SAVE
   ├─ Move "Dom" rows to end
   ├─ Apply Excel formatting (bold headers, centering, yellow Dom rows)
   ├─ Auto-adjust column widths
   └─ Save with timestamp
```
